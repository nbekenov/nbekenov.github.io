I recently came across a really interesting [article](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/automating-safe-hands-off-deployments/?did=ba_card&trk=ba_card) by @clare_liguori. I higly recommend reading it.

Going throug over projects of the author I accidentally became avare of github pages and jekyll.
And I decided to use it for my own humble website. So here is my initial commit =)
